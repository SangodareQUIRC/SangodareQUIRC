## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**SangodareQUIRC/SangodareQUIRC** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on tools to support leaders in niche markets/under-resourced communities.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to connect tools and create dashboards (lovable, vercel, render, n8n, squarespace).
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on connecting and growing more product designers and engineers in niche communities.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding product designers from niche (LGBTQ, LGBTQIA, BIPOC, disabled communities)
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about how I started out in digital tech, moved to analog tech and now am merging the two.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: instagram and linkedin for "professional" discourse.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: all of them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love legos. I plan to use my engineering with Legos curricula to teach kids life lessons (aka Growth & Transformation for kids and the kids in us all).
