## Hi there 👋
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on tools to support leaders in niche markets/under-resourced communities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to connect tools and create dashboards (lovable, vercel, render, n8n, squarespace).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on connecting and growing more product designers and engineers in niche communities.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding product designers from niche (LGBTQ, LGBTQIA, BIPOC, disabled communities)
- 💬 Ask me about how I started out in digital tech, moved to analog tech and now am merging the two.
- 📫 How to reach me: instagram and linkedin for "professional" discourse.
- 😄 Pronouns: all of them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love legos. I plan to use my engineering with Legos curricula to teach kids life lessons (aka Growth & Transformation for kids and the kids in us all).
